</head>
<body>
    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: September 15, 2025</p>
    <p>Water Monitor App ("we" or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data when you use our app.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>This app stores water intake data locally on your device using SQLite for offline use. No personal information (e.g., name, email) is collected or transmitted unless you enable optional cloud synchronization with Firebase, which requires user authentication.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or rent your data to third parties. Local data is used solely to track your water intake within the app.</p>
    
    <h2>Cloud Sync (Optional)</h2>
    <p>If you enable cloud sync via Firebase, your water intake data may be stored on Firebase servers. This requires your explicit consent through authentication. You can disable sync at any time.</p>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect local data. However, no method is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</h2>
